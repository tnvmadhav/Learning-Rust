Rust dynamics learnt:
1. If a mutable variable is defined, then we must have an overrided assignment, otherwise keep all the variables immutable by default
2. Formatting of strings during println! statements (similar to f strings in python :D)
3. Using 'rustfmt' as a standard code formatting tool
4. About 'rustc --explain EXXXX' tool to learn any type of compile errors <3 <3
